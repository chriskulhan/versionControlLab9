If you type python app.py in terminal doesn't work and you get a flask error, type these each separately and run them. 

python -m venv venv 
source venv/bin/activate
pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy

pip install --upgrade pip


Then check to see the 3rd one doesn't have ANOTHER command to run. Try python app.py again once that's done.
